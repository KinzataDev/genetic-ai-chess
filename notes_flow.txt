FLOW:

Start up service to request games
GameManager
	Service queries DB for most recent generation, pulls in 2 strands that haven't played
	Sends strands off via MQ to be played -> GameControllerProcess (via MQ backend)

	Polls every once in a while for all strands to have completed games.
	Once done, retrieves them based on the selection rules and sends them to be processed.
	New children are inserted into DB under a new generation.

GameControllerProcess
	Builds 2 AI players via the strands.
	Creates actual GameController object and kicks off the game
	When done, records winner in the DB if there was one, along with any relevant info

	If given just a generation, find 2 strands, have them play.
	If given strands, have them play.

	If given players, use the player's strands.

	If not given players, create players for the strands if none can be found.

AttemptSetup
	Loads the default Strand for a set amount of strands then randomizes them based on the min/max values.
	Creates a new generation as a new attempt.  Marks the previous generation as complete.
